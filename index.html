    <h1> Visual Studio Code and Console Screen</h1>
    <p> Visual Studio Code, also commonly referred to as VS Code, is a source-code editor made by
      Microsoft with the Electron Framework, for Windows, Linux and macOS. Features include support for 
      debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and 
      embedded Git. Users can change the theme, keyboard shortcuts, preferences, and install extensions
     that add additional functionality.

        In the Stack Overflow 2021 Developer Survey, Visual Studio Code was ranked the most popular
        developer environment tool among 82,000 respondents, with 70% reporting that they use it.</p>

        <p> Windows Console is the infrastructure for console applications in Microsoft Windows. An
             instance of a Windows Console has a screen buffer and an input buffer. It allows console 
             apps to run inside a window or in hardware text mode (so as to occupy the entire screen).
             The user can switch between the two using the Alt+â†µ Enter key combination. The text mode is
             unavailable in Windows Vista and later. Starting with Windows 10, however, a native 
             full-screen mode is available.</p>
